[SEI] This module should help you to quickly reach your online video course for semester 2

You shall install the following packages to make it work :
dpkg, xclip, khal(optional)

Then to install startmyclass, do as follow :

-Go to the startmyclass directory and open terminal
-Run the command 'sudo ./INSTALL'
-Follow the instruction if it is displayed that other packages are necessary
-You can now run startmyclass by typing "startmyclass"

-If you wish to use the calendar (with khal installed) option, you should update the calendar at least once ("startmyclass -u")

NB:
If you wish to use the calendar (with khal installed) option, you should update regularly the calendar (every week
  at least).

NB2:
If you want to add a link of a zoom class / modificate a link,
you can simply open the "launcher" file in /bin/startmyclass/launcher. But if you re-install the package, all modification will be over-written

NB3:
If you already use khal as agenda, it could interfere with this program, so be sure to save all your personal agendas, and your config files before using any command wich works with khal.
